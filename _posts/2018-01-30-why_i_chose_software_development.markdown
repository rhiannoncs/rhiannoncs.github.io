I am a librarian, which might at first glance seem pretty far removed from web development. The training I have received and skills I have developed along the way to where I am now, however, have prepared me for this next move. When I was working on my Master's I focused on technology and my favorite classes were Database Design, in which we learned SQL, and Information Architecture, where I learned to make websites using WordPress and Drupal. There are many times I have wished I made the switch to web development then!

I did not, however, and I chose to spend a few years staying home with my children after graduating from library school. Before moving back to libraries full time I worked for a startup on content curation. I loved the atmosphere of constant iterative improvement and the energy of working to get the website and apps off the ground. That is one thing that has drawn me to software development - the field is so focused on being forward thinking and constantly trying to learn and make things better.

When I moved into my current job as an adult services librarian at a small public library, a project I took on was creating a new library website, which should launch soon.  I have been using WordPress and remembering how much I enjoy the website development process. I wanted a feature that would enable users to search either the library catalog or the site from one search box, with a toggle to switch between. Unable to find a plug-in that suited my needs, I researched the JavaScript required to make it. Creating that and getting it working was incredibly rewarding, even as it was occasionally frustrating along the way. The thought of having those kinds of gains in my day-to-day work is incredibly appealing.

So, I suppose that is why I have chosen to move to software development. The desire to be in a field that prizes innovation, the opportunity to make things that will solve the problems we face in our lives, and because it's just a lot of fun.
